# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

The data consisted of 294478 rows and 5 columns. The finding showed that there is not enough evidence to conclude that there is a significant difference between treatment and control group that lead more conversion. The proportion of control group slightly higher than the treatment group. However, we do not know one page is better than the other for a certain amount time. Therefore, the A/B Test require to understand the significant difference between treatment and control groups. The regression result indicated no significant effect between conversion and ab_page (p> .05). The p-value that is associated with ab_page is 0.189. This value is different than the value in part II because A/B test and logistic regression maintain different different hypothesizes. In part III, the null and alternative hypotheses for the regression model are Hnull:Pnew=Pold and Halternative: Pnewâ‰ Pold, and it is a two-tail test. In part II, A/B test, the null and alternative hypotheses for the regression model are Hnull: Pold>= Pnew and Halternative: Pnew> Pold and A/B test is a one-tail test. The other independent variables may influence the conversion rate. If we have data, we can run a regression to understand how the other independent variables affect the conversion rate. The logistic regression model indicated no significant effect between the independent variable (country) and the dependent variable (conversion). Country does not impact the conversion.
